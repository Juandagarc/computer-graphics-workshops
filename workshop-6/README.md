## üìù Solved Exercises

The following are the workshop exercises implemented in English with a simplified menu.

### **Exercise 1: Array Creation and Reshaping**

**Objective:** Create an array with numbers from 1 to 15 and then reshape it to a 3x5 matrix.

---

### **Exercise 2: Basic Arithmetic Operations**

**Objective:** Calculate the total sum, mean, and product of all elements in array 'A' created previously.

---

### **Exercise 3: Element Access and Slicing**

**Objective:** Extract a specific portion of array 'A', corresponding to the second and third elements of the second row.

---

### **Exercise 4: Boolean Indexing Filtering**

**Objective:** Create a new array 'B' from 'A' containing only elements whose value is greater than 7.

---

### **Exercise 5: Linear Algebra Operations**

**Objective:** Create a 3x3 square matrix 'C' and calculate its determinant and inverse matrix.

---

### **Exercise 6: Basic Statistical Analysis**

**Objective:** Generate an array 'D' of 100 random numbers and calculate main statistics: maximum, minimum, mean, and standard deviation.

---

### **Exercise 7: Trigonometric Functions Plot**

**Objective:** Visualize sine and cosine functions in the same plot within the range of -2œÄ to 2œÄ.

---

### **Exercise 8: Scatter Plot Creation**

**Objective:** Create a scatter plot using the values of random array 'D' on the Y-axis and their corresponding indices on the X-axis.

---

### **Exercise 9: Histogram Creation**

**Objective:** Generate a histogram to visualize the distribution of data in random array 'D', adjusting the number of bins.

---

### **Exercise 10: Basic Image Manipulation**

**Objective:** Load an image file, process it to convert to grayscale, and display both versions, original and modified.
